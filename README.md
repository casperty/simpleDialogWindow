# Simple Dialog Window
*Created by MKL &amp; AR.*

Actually created to talk simply during the course. Your neighbour sees what you're writing on your screen.
Not a great stuff. But nice when you need to talk during course.

**Shortcuts :**
- Esc button : erase the text.
- F1 button : minimize the window

Next step is to create a real chat application. ;)
